function [CovBEF,EigValBEF] = BEF(SampleRet,distribution,spacing,RollingCorr)
% Author: Torsten MÃ¶rstedt, Bernhard Lutz, Dirk Neumann
% Function calculates the Bayesian Eigenvalue Rescaling Covariance Matrix as
% outlined in "Bayesian Bayesian Eigenvalue Rescaling for CovarianceEstimation in Portfolio Optimization"
% Setting used in the paper: [CovBEF,EigValBEF] = fnBEF(ReturnMatrix,'Beta_2_6','Linear',HistoricRollingCorrelationVector)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Mandatory Input:   
%       SampleRet: TxN matrix of asset returns
% Optional Input:
%       distribution: 'Normal','Beta_2_3','Beta_2_6'
%       spacing: 'Log','Linear','Wigner'
%       RollingCorr: 1xT matrix of rolling average cross-correlation values based on the
%       return matrix basket
% Example: 
%       [CovBEF,EigValBEF] = BEF(randn(100,10),'Normal','Log',[0.4,0.35,0.3]);
%           randn(100,10):  TxN matrix of asset returns
%           [0.4,0.35,0.3]: 1xT matrix of rolling average cross-correlation
